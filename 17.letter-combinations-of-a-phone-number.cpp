 * Testcase Example:  '"23"'
 *
 * Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible
 * letter combinations that the number could represent.
 * 
 * A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given
 * below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: "23"
 * Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be
 * in any order you want.
